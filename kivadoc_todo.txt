-parse warnings (e.g. style not closed, unknown cross-reference, invalid header)
	-StyleParser errors

TODO LATER:
====================
-glossary, references
-code, images, formulas could have captions and allow for cross-references.
-numbered headers
-latex back-end
-definitions (dl,dt,dd)
	; term 1
	: definition 1
	:; term 2
	:: definition 2
-footnotes ((footnote))
-include other documents (\include-directives to compose a document out of many fragments)
-horizontal rule: ----
-user-defined macros:
	%YES% => image:/res/yes.png
	%YES% => (% color: green %)[YES]

TODO MAYBE:
====================
-syntax highlighting
-"TODO markers"
-emitter that emits neat-looking version of the input document. pretty-printer
	-many different ways to format e.g. code-blocks, tables, comment-blocks. How to preserve the original style? 
	-comments need to be preserved
-Javadoc-integration (include Javadoc html into the document)
-list element LI could be parsed with a nested DocumentParser. Then there would be no
 crazy logic about overriding blockTarget, and listParser could handle the whole list
 all by itself..simplifying the tangled logic.
 	-difficulty: how to find out where a LI ends? It might have an embedded comment-block with empty lines inside it
-ditaa (http://ditaa.sourceforge.net/) or graphviz
-other types of boxes that stand out (e.g. red background box) (can be done using style classes and style blocks)

DONE:
====================
-header:
	toc: full
-ability to use classes in styling (style: style attribute)
-custom style sheets (style: header attribute)
-emitter errors
-invalid internal reference
-in tables: check that even the last row has enough data
-nested documents (table cells) line numbers need to be adjusted
-ParagraphParser errors
-wp: bg color for table cells + alignment
-instead of \\ for line break, use ~ ("escape new line")
-(% width:20em; float:left %)image:foo.png[Hello world] (works, just needs a line break after %))
-ParagraphParser is called per line, not per paragraph. so style can't continue to next line
-this does not work: 
	"-**foo**: bar"
-links that have [.)] after the link, that character is used as part of the link. 
 Usually this is not wanted. Also it might be useful to say image:foo.png[]. 
 So that the []-part ends the macro (but without causing the alt-text or body-text 
 to be empty). http://foo.bar[] should produce same result as plain http://foo.bar .
-css style is not applied to empty td cells
-toc (toc:auto, toc:none, toc:full)
-optional == at the end of single-line headers
-fix colspan, rowspan	
-table formatting (cell alignment, spans, bg color)
-styling of paragraphs, table cells and tables with (( width:20em ))
-wiki-link. Analogous to http://foo.bar[Foo], have {foo}[Foo]
-anchors: {#goto} and then: ##goto## target place!
-should be able to use |-character in tables inside images,links,alt,src etc using ~|.
-multiline tables, escaping of |-character
-list continuation (+)
-ordered lists. Use # or .? # for anchor? But # is very commonly used for ordered lists. And anchors are rare.
-http://www.wikicreole.org/wiki/Creole1.0
-styling: (% color:blue %)
-lite table syntax that doesn't need |===-delims
	|=Title 1|=Title 2
	|Word 1|Word 2
-Table styling:
	 -Use a thick rule to denote headlines and thin rules to separate lines. 
	 -Don't use alternate background colours in rows, just use one and white. 
	 -If you can, don't use vertical lines. Let the data in the tables indicate the columns. 
	 -To give emphasis to a column heading, set it in CAPS. 
	 -To emphasise a column, set it in bold, or highlight with a different background colour. 
	 -Range numerical data right. 
	 -Give more padding to the bottom of items than to the top. You can still keep the same overall line�height, but this gives the reader a sense of more whitespace.
-escaping, e.g. \*. Or ~* (Creole).
-colors ([red]#red text#) or (% color:red %)[red text]
-image links possible? http://foo.bar[image:show.png\[cat\]]
	-in WP, one doesn't need to escape nested brackets: [[foo|[[image]] bar]] works.
-"Single punctuation characters (,.?!:;"') at the end of URLs should not be considered part of the URL."
-line break. \\ in creole, + in asciidoc
-special characters:
	-ellipsis: u2026
	-single quotes: &#8216 for left, &#8217 for right
	-double-quotes: &#8220; for left, &#8221; for right
	-em-dash: U+2014
		-in AD: &#8201;&#8212;&#8201;
	-arrow =>: &#8658;
	-arrow ->: &#8594;
	- → ← ↔ ⇒ ⇐ ⇔ » « – — 640×480 © ™ ®
	- -> <- <-> => <= <=> >> << -- --- 640x480 (c) (tm) (r)
-//italics// (conflicts with comments)
-nested _*emphasis*_
	-**//bold italics//**
	-//**bold italics**//
	-//This is **also** good.//
-use doubled ** for emphasis..it's used so rarely
-forced**emphasis**
-comment blocks
-link:foo/bar.html
-https,ftp,mailto parsing
-image:foo.png
-old feature list:
	*titles, subtitles
	*TOC
	*lists (ordered, unordered)
		*nested
	-references
	*bold, italic fonts
	*tables
	*"comments" that are not part of the document and not shown in "final" version

MISC:
====================

		-monospace (++)
		-images
		-links
		-indented lists
	-Creole

Improvements to DocuWiki:
-svn integration
-more flex table syntax
-easier list syntax (no double space start)
-easier header syntax (no ending ==)
-better control macros (~~NOTOC~~ vs toc:none)
-comment blocks
-better link syntax

Improvements to TWiki/FOSwiki:
-svn integration
-better syntax (no 3-space headings, simpler headers, no escaping needed for &<>)
-hierarchies

XWiki is pretty good: http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/XWikiSyntax
