KivaDoc
=======

KivaDoc is a document mark-up language that has been inspired by AsciiDoc, 
Creole and XWiki.

This project is a Java library that can convert KivaDoc documents into HTML.
This README file is an example of a valid KivaDoc document. Open up 
syntax.html to learn the syntax by examples.


Features
--------

* Compact syntax. Inspiration from AsciiDoc, Creole and XWiki.
* KivaDoc is fast. Here are some benchmarks of Java parsers for Markdown,
  a considerably simpler mark-up language, compared with KivaDoc:
	* KivaDoc: 430 docs/sec
	* MarkdownPapers: 300 docs/sec
	* markdownj: 17 docs/sec
	* pegdown: 48 docs/sec
* Plain Java with no parsing libraries used, yet a rather small codebase.
* Two-phase conversion process: First the mark-up is parsed
  into a DOM structure (org.kivadoc.dom), which can then be
  converted into HTML and possibly other output formats.  
  DocHtmlEmitter.java + HtmlBuilder.java is only 600 lines of code.
  An emitter for DocBook, Latex and other formats should be a similar 
  amount of code.
* Advanced features such as nested tables, row/col spans, cross-references
  and table-of-contents generation.
* Produces a list of warnings/errors for malformed documents (missing
  internal link targets, bad syntax etc).


Basic API usage
---------------

Here's an example of using the very high level API to the library:

  // read the document from a file perhaps
  String kivadoc = "hello world\n======\n\nfirst paragraph";
  // parse it to a DOM structure
  KivaDocument doc = new FullDocumentParser().parse(kivadoc);
  // convert it to HTML
  FullHtmlEmitter emitter = new FullHtmlEmitter();
  String html = emitter.toHtmlString(doc);
  // print it?
  System.out.println(html);
  // => prints out "<h1>hello world</h1><p>first paragraph </p>"
  
  // no parser errors?
  System.out.println(doc.getErrors().isEmpty()); // => true
  // no emitter errors?
  System.out.println(emitter.getErrors().isEmpty()); // => true


Building
--------

The project is built with Maven ( http://maven.apache.org/ ). Simply
run the command

 $ mvn install
